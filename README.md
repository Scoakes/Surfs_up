# Surfs_up

##Overview
Our busniness partner has reached out and requested that we compile more data. Specifically, they are interested in whether the weather will allow for year-round success of our surf/icecream shop. To provide this data we are going to look at summary statistics of the weather in Oahu during June and December.

###Results 
-In June we had a total count of 1700 measurements, a high temperature of 85 F and a low of 64 F.
-In Dec we had a total count of 1517 measurements, a high of 83 F and a low of 56 F.
-June had an average temp of 74.94 F while Dec had an average of 71.04 F.

####Summary 
From the data described above it would seem that Jun and Dec have similar enough temperatures to sustain year-round business. However, there are other factors that we may want to query to bolster these claims. For instance, temperature may vary widely in these months which could affect business. We could also collect information of the surf conditions during these monnths, this would affect where we may want to build our shop as well as whether it could be sucessful year-round.
